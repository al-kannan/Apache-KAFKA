To remove all topics and start over do the following :
- Go the /data/kafka directory where kafka topics are kept and do a rm -rf ./*
- Go to zookeeper Navigator and remove kafka folder completely
- start the kafka, you will see new set of files populated in /data/kafka folder and zookeeper should have kafka folder back with no non system topics
