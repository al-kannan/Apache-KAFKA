Consumer Group is basically group of consumers consume a single topic with a consumer group id

If a topic has 3 partitions, when you start the first consumer with a consumer group id of say "Grp 1" all three partitions will be assigned to this process

When we start the next run of the same consumer group code on the same machine or on a different machine then Kafka will rebalance the consumers within the consumer group, you will see the log messages that partion 1 will be given to the new consumer within the same group

If we start third one then a partition will be assigned 

If we start the fourth will then since no extra partition is left, fourth session will sit idle
